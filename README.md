# Pet-Management
Pet-Management is a management software. It is used for the management of the animals to be adopted.

Pet-Management is a simple management software. 
It has been designed for the management of animals to be adopted in a "Pet Adoption Center".

The behavior of our management system (ERP = enterprise resource planning) is:

Our ERP is able to add a new pet that has arrived to our "Pet Adoption Center", in order to upload it to our ERP. 
These added data, we can also modify them, if necessary.

We can also ask our ERP to list all the pets we have in the database, or the characteristics of a specific one for when it will be adopted. 
In case of adoption, we will need to delete the register, so this action can also be done with our ERP.

And finally, the ERP allows us to add an external .csv file (Excel file, for example) to our database.
